# Nude Exchange Protocol
This protocol is peer to peer so no server can save your private pictures.
It uses a 3 stage verification process and only if both parties accept all of them the image will be saved to the respective computers.
In the preliminary phase you have the option to apply blur and black boxes to censor out key aspects of the image.
After that the edited version is exchanged and the verification phase begins.
Both parties have to accept the edited image and if that happens the same image is exchanged again but this time without the blur added.
This step is there to prevent malicious actors from applying blur to the image before sending it via the protocol.
Following this the original version is sent and it too has to be approved by both parties before saving locally.
